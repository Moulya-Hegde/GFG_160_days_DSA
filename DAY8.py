class Solution:
    def maximumProfit(self, prices):
        if not prices or len(prices)<2:
            return 0
        min_p=float("inf")
        max_profit=0
        for i in prices:
            min_p=min(min_p,i)
            profit=i-min_p
            max_profit=max(profit,max_profit)
        return max_profit
